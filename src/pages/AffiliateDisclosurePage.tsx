        <h3>What Are Affiliate Links?</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the links on E-comCoupons.com are "affiliate links." This means that if you click on the link and purchase the item 
          or sign up for a service, E-comCoupons.com will receive an affiliate commission. This is at no additional cost to you. In fact, 
          in many cases, our affiliate relationships allow us to offer you exclusive discounts that you wouldn't find elsewhere.
        </p>
