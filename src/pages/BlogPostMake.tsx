                <p>
                  Make.com is a powerful visual automation platform that allows you to connect apps and automate workflows without writing a single line of code. It serves as the glue between your various business applications, enabling them to work together seamlessly.

                <h2>Key Features That Make Make.com Stand Out</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Intuitive Visual Interface</h3>
                <p>
                  One of Make.com's most impressive features is its visual workflow builder. Unlike many automation tools that rely on text-based configurations, Make.com offers a canvas where you can design your workflows visually. This intuitive interface makes it easy to understand the flow of data and the relationships between different steps in your automation. You can see exactly how information moves from one app to another, making it easier to build, troubleshoot, and optimize your workflows.
                </p>
                
                <h3>2. Extensive App Integrations</h3>
                <p>
                  Make.com boasts connections with over 1,000 apps and services, from popular platforms like Google Workspace, Slack, and Shopify to specialized tools for specific industries. This vast library of integrations means you can connect virtually any service you use in your business. If you happen to use a tool that isn't directly supported, Make.com offers HTTP/webhook modules and a JSON parser that allow you to work with any API.
                </p>
                
                <h3>3. Advanced Data Handling</h3>
                <p>
                  Make.com excels at manipulating and transforming data between systems. Its powerful data mapping capabilities allow you to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Transform data formats (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Aggregate information from multiple sources</li>
                  <li>Filter and sort data based on complex conditions</li>
                  <li>Perform calculations and string operations</li>
                  <li>Work with arrays and collections of data</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>4. Sophisticated Error Handling</h3>
                <p>
                  Reliability is crucial for business automation. Make.com provides robust error handling capabilities that allow your workflows to gracefully manage exceptions. You can set up custom error handling paths, retry failed operations, and receive notifications when issues occur. This ensures that your critical business processes continue to run smoothly even when unexpected problems arise.
                </p>
                
                <h3>5. Flexible Execution Options</h3>
                <p>
                  Make.com offers multiple ways to trigger your automations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Scheduled triggers: Run workflows at specific times or intervals</li>
                  <li>Webhook triggers: Execute workflows when data is received from external sources</li>
                  <li>Watching triggers: Monitor for changes in connected apps and respond accordingly</li>
                  <li>Manual execution: Run scenarios on demand or via API</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>6. Powerful Iteration Capabilities</h3>
                <p>
                  Make.com's iterators and aggregators allow you to process collections of data efficiently. You can loop through arrays, process batches of records, and aggregate results. This is particularly valuable for bulk operations like updating multiple records, processing batches of orders, or sending personalized communications to lists of contacts.
                </p>
